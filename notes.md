# NOTES ON THIS WHOLE WEBGL THING

- probably recommend Pixie (barish)

- Phase is built on Pixi, Pixi markets itself as fastest, most flexible 2D WebGL renderer

- pixi advantage: if no WebGL support, it will fall back to canvas (will be performance drop, but still will work)

- three JS is built for 3D so probably overkill for something like this

## CONCEPT

- build webGL via pixie
- add distortion on mouse hover
- change background image on mouse hover, increasing circle as click length grows
- add routes
- 

## EXAMPLE
- Effect found (here)[http://www.marinimarmi.com/en/]
- Looks like they are using greensock, no shaders available in JS files

## PIXI NOTES
- u_mask: increase value to zoom in on picture
